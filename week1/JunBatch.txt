What is a class?
           Class is a group of object which have common properties, 
It is a Blueprint or template from which objects are created.
A java class can contain field,methods,variables,constructor and block of code

What is an Object?
An instance of  a class is called object
Object is real time entity or real world entity

syntax for object
ClassName objectName = new ClassName or Constructor();

main Method:
public static void main(String[] args){
-----------
}

JDK -- Java Development kit

Compiler:
Compiler it is a translator, it is used to convert user level language into 
machine level language and machine level language into user 
level language.

1.Explain about the main method in java?

	Main() method is the entry point of any standalone java application. 
The syntax of main method ispublic static void main(String args[]). 
Main method is public and static so that java can access it without initializing the class. 
The input parameter is an array of String through which we can pass runtime arguments to the java program. 

public : Public is an access modifier, which is used to specify 
who can access this method. Public means that this Method will be accessible by 
any Class.

static : It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class 
based i.e it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class.

void : It is the return type of the method. Void defines the method 
which will not return any value.

main: It is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a 
starting point for an application with a particular signature only. 
It is the method where the main execution occur.

String args[] : It is the parameter passed to the main method.



Operators:
Arithmatic Operator
+,_,*,/,%

int a=5;
int b=5;
int c=a+b;

a=4
b=2
a/b=2

4%2=0
5%5=0

System.out.println(c);
Relational Operator
>,<,>=,<=,!=,==
6>1
6>1
a==b


a=b
a!=b
Logic Operator
&&,||,!

Naming Conventions:
Class Name: --Pascal Notations
 class name start with capital, When we have multile words the 
first letter should be captital and the second word onwords Init Should be capital

Variable Name, method Name: camelCase
 variable name and method name start with lowercase, When we have multile words the 
first letter should be lowercase and the second word onwords Init Should be capital
